# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without any player winning, the game results in a tie.
